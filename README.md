# Inception of Things

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) aka k8s and using [k3s](https://k3s.io/) with [k3d](https://k3d.io/), it's a dev ops project.

## VM quickstart

> :warning: `ctrl` + `alt` to relase the mouse/keyboard from the vm

On the school computers create a vm with Virtual Machine Manager. You need to downlaod the ubuntu LTS to goinfre: 

```bash
cd ~/goinfre && wget https://releases.ubuntu.com/24.04.2/ubuntu-24.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso
```

Launch VMM, create a new volume on groinfre (goinfre is the local disc, the vm will be more responsive), 20 gigs is fine. Then create a virtual machine using this new volume and the downloaded iso. Follow ubuntu instrution to complete installation.


# Part 1

AUTO-SCALE : Need more containers ? Just deploy more machine

HIGH-AVAILABILITY : One machine is down ? Instant replace with a new one

CLUSTER : System deployed on Kubernetes

CONTROL-PLANE : API that can handle internal and external requests to manage the nodes cluster, got his own key value database
called etcd that store information about running the cluster

Each node is running a kubelet (app that communicate back with the main control plane)

Inside of each node, we have multiple pods (docker container)

k3s = kubernetes distribution (3 is more than 8, mean it's more approchable and less complex than k8s)
k3s default ingress controller = traefik
1 container runtime at installation time - containerd
virtual networking - flannel
cluster service discovery - CoreDNS
Embedded load balander - Klipper-lb

Difference with classic k8s : cloud provider-specific code (replaced by Cloud Control Manager)
third party-specific storage drivers (replaced by Container Storage Interface)

Nodes in k3s can also perform work (maybe that's why in the Part 2 of the project, we can run the applications with only 1 VM)

 It is STRONGLY advised to allow only the bare minimum in terms of resources: 1 CPU, 512 MB of RAM (or 1024). The machines must be run using Vagrant. (This rule in the subject i guess is to prevent adding any work on the node, you can run k3s with that amount of ressources because it's the amount required for the control plane function to work, not more)

Any type of other kubernetes distribution would need at least double of that ressources to run. (how ? k3s is packaged as a single binary)

K8S -> Every node got his own control plane
K3S -> One control plane, n nodes

How to check K3s is running ? 
sudo systemctl status k3s (server node)
sudo systemctl status k3s-agent (worker node)

# Part 2: Kubernetes Vagrant Environment with K3s and Traefik Ingress

This part of the project sets up a lightweight Kubernetes (K3s) environment using Vagrant and VirtualBox, with three containerized web applications and Ingress-based routing via Traefik.

---

## üß∞ Project Overview

- Uses **Debian Bookworm** as the base VM
- Installs and configures **K3s** with **Traefik Ingress**
- Deploys **three simple web applications**
- Configures Ingress routing using domain names: `app1.com`, `app2.com`, `app3.com`
- Accessible via `curl` or browser using mapped hostnames

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Timothee-BRANDT/Iot.git
cd Iot/p2
```

### 2. Start the VM

```bash
vagrant up
```

This will:
- Set up the VM with 2 CPUs and 2GB RAM
- Assign it the IP: `192.168.56.110`
- Provision it using `setup.sh` (K3s, Helm, Traefik, Kubernetes resources)

---

## üîê Access the VM

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

---

## ‚úÖ Post-Setup Verification

### üì° Check Network Interface

```bash
ip addr show eth1
```

The interface `eth1` exists and shows `192.168.56.110`.

---

### üè∑Ô∏è Check Hostname

```bash
hostname
```

---

### üß™ Verify K3s Installation

```bash
systemctl status k3s
k3s --version
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -A
```

---

### üìå Validate Node Info

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

---

### üîç Validate Application Deployments

```bash
kubectl get all
```

> The second app should have **3 replicas**.

---

## üåê Ingress Verification

### 1. Check Ingress Setup

```bash
kubectl get ingress
kubectl describe ingress hello-apps-ingress
```

**Rules** section to verify correct domain-based routing.

---

### 2. Test Access to Applications

Use `curl` to verify the Ingress routing:

```bash
# App1
curl -H "Host: app1.com" 192.168.56.110

# App2
curl -H "Host: app2.com" 192.168.56.110

# App3
curl -H "Host: app3.com" 192.168.56.110

# Default fallback
curl 192.168.56.110
```

---

## üß≠ Services Overview

```bash
kubectl get svc -n traefik
```

---

## üìù Notes

- Host entries for `app1.com`, `app2.com`, `app3.com` are added to `/etc/hosts` in the VM.
- Traefik is installed via Helm with host networking.
- Default Ingress route points to **app3**.

---

# Part 3 

## Usefull commands

```bash
# configs
kubectl config view

kubectl apply  -f file.yaml -n namespace

kubectl delete -f file.yaml -n namespace

kubectl get namespaces

k3d cluster delte somename

argocd app [list|delete|..etc]
```

## Setup

- Install [k3d](https://k3d.io/stable/#releases) which is a wrapper to run k3s in docker and k3s is a lightweight k8s runtime. Basically test Kubernetes stuff on your laptop without spinning up a nuclear reactor.

- Install vscode extension [vscode-k3d](https://github.com/inercia/vscode-k3d/) to make managing everything easier.
